Hi! I'm Hollie, a game programmer at Lively/Electric Square and a committee member at [Limit Break](https://www.limitbreak.co.uk/) where I volunteer on the operations team. I was also chosen to join the [IMPACT](https://www.manycats.uk/impact) cohort ran by Many Cats Studios which showcases and celebrates disabled and neurodiverse developers.

I use C#, C++, Unity and UE5 to develop mobile, VR and PC/Console Games. I have experience in live ops, rapid prototyping and I'm currently working on a really exciting unannounced game shh!

I enjoy working closely with designers and getting stuck into how the mechanics feel. I love implemented gameplay systems, figuring out a weird bug or diving into a large codebase. I care about creating readable and extendable code in the hope that nothing I write bites me or my colleagues in the butt in the future. I get a kick out of technical challenges and never want to stop learning.
